Project: Scheduler with Message Queue

Submitted By: Saleem Thapa

Project Description:

This project extends the functionality of a scheduler system by introducing a message queue. 
The project includes two executables: `oss` and `worker`. 
The `oss` executable manages worker processes and coordinates their activities through a message queue. 
The system clock is maintained independently from the main system clock and is shared among the processes.
Each process is represented by a Process Control Block (PCB) in a process table.

Worker Behavior:

Workers receive two arguments indicating their expected duration.
They perform iterations by waiting for messages from `oss` and periodically checking the clock.
Workers send messages back to `oss` based on their checks.

Oss, the Parent Behavior:

`oss` is responsible for launching worker processes based on command-line arguments. It manages the system clock, process table, and message queues. Additionally, `oss` controls the order in which workers access the clock.

Command Line Parameters:
-n: Total number of children
-s: Maximum simultaneous children
-t: Time limit for child processes
-f: Log file

`oss` outputs information to both the log file and the screen, while worker output is not logged.

Instructions:

Compilation:

Ensure you have GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed on your system.

1. Open your terminal and type command :   make clean
2. To compile the project, run the following command: make
3. To start with the oss :  ./oss -n 2 -s 3 -t 3 -f logfile.txt
4. To start with worker : ./worker 5 500000
